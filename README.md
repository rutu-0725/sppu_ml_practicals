- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with code implementations for each practical.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for standalone implementations.
- **Reports**: Documentation and reports for each practical, detailing observations and conclusions.

## Practicals

1. **Linear Regression**: Building and evaluating a linear regression model.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification.
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Understanding and applying the KNN algorithm.
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Using SVM for classification tasks.
5. **Decision Trees**: Building and visualizing decision tree models.
6. **Random Forests**: Ensemble learning with random forests.
7. **Clustering**: Exploring clustering techniques, such as K-Means.
8. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Implementing PCA for dimensionality reduction.
9. **Neural Networks**: Basics of neural networks and hands-on implementation.
10. **Model Evaluation**: Techniques for evaluating and tuning models.
